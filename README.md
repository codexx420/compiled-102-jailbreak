Most reliable solution. 

## Update
I uploaded the files for my iPad Air 2 as extra_recipe works much better than yalu102. A few months ago, tihmstar and other contributors released "Double H3lix" which works very stable. I highly recommend using that!

# Compiled 10.2 Jailbreaks 
As I recently lost a VERY good compiled working version of extra_recipe for my iPad Air 2 which seems to be very unsupported in jailbreaking, I decided to create this repository for myself and maybe other people. I couln't find the the compiled versions. After may tries, I got my jb back. 

# iPad Air 2 Note
As I mentioned, it's very unstable on the Air 2.   
yalu102 beta7. Tries: 1 to > 50
